## About 

As a software developer or even someone just starting out in the world of programming, you've probably faced the following challenges:

1. Your code runs locally, but doesn't work in a specific auto-grading tool: the famous "but it works on my machine";

2. You have test cases with (what looks like) infinite input characters;

3. In an online test, having to submit a file several times to test if your solution is passing on all test cases.

Hitches like these can make things a little more difficult than they need to be and take the focus away from what really matters at the moment: YOUR CODE.

It is with these and other setbacks in mind that **test.me** was designed. As a way to optimize what is really important: YOUR TIME.
